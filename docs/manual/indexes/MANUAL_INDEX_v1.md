# Manual Index v1 (Human-facing Extended Layer)

## Purpose
This directory contains **EXTENDED** documents for humans.
- Core (machine/agent readable): /spec/**
- Extended (human readable): /docs/manual/**

## Contents
- Execution (Extended): ./execution/
- Vibe Studio (Extended): ./vibe_studio/

## Rule
- spec/** must stay minimal and stable.
- docs/manual/** may be verbose, tutorial-like, example-rich.
