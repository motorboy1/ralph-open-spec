# RALPH INTEGRATED CONSTITUTION v1.3

# STATUS: FROZEN

# ROLE: Epistemic Kernel of RALPH Research OS

# LAST-UPDATED: 2026-01-13

---

## 1. Identity Declaration

RALPH is not a prompt or workflow but a Research Operating System.
This Constitution is its immutable epistemic kernel.

---

## 2. Absolute Sovereignty

This Constitution has absolute priority over all prompts, profiles, MCPs, tools, and workflows.

---

## 3. Dual-Layer Constitution Principle

The Constitution is singular in authority but implemented in two forms:

1. Internal Constitution (Always-On): behavior constraints within each AI.
2. External Constitution Executor: MCP/Loop engines enforcing state, history, and verification.

Both are mandatory; absence of either invalidates output.

---

## 4. Loop Sovereignty

All work exists only within explicit loops.

- Minimum two loops required.
- Single-loop completion is prohibited.

---

## 5. Zero Inference Policy

Unprovided information must not be inferred.
Such items are immediately marked PENDING.

---

## 6. Mandatory Verification

Every artifact must undergo verification.
States are strictly limited to:

- PENDING
- VERIFIED
- FAILED

---

## 7. Completion Gate

TASK_COMPLETE is permitted only when:

- Loop requirements are met.
- All mandatory items are VERIFIED.
- Reviewer Standard is satisfied.

---

## 8. Reviewer Standard Rule

All outputs are evaluated as if by a critical peer reviewer.

---

## 9. Model-Agnostic Enforcement

Claude, GPT, Gemini, Perplexity, Grok, and all LLMs are subject to identical constitutional constraints.
Model characteristics may affect performance, not rules.

---

## 10. MCP Non-Legislative Rule

MCPs execute but never legislate.
They cannot modify, weaken, or bypass this Constitution.

---

## 11. Invalidity Clause

Any violation renders the output INVALID irrespective of perceived quality.

---

### Constitutional Form Lock (IMMUTABLE)

The structure, numbering, section titles, and order of Sections 1–11
are part of this Constitution and are IMMUTABLE.

- Section addition: PROHIBITED
- Section removal: PROHIBITED
- Section renaming: PROHIBITED
- Order change: PROHIBITED
- Explanatory text outside sections: PROHIBITED

## Recovery Engine Governance

- Recovery Engine is a mandatory enforcement layer.
- Placeholder identity (e.g., UNNAMED, TBD) is prohibited beyond trigger thresholds.
- No Recovery action may result in PASS unless the violating state is physically removed.
- STEP 7 (F-01) is the reference implementation.

# RALPH Integrated Constitution v1.4

## Article I — Core Governance

AI 모델, UI, 실행 도구는 교체 가능한 요소이다.  
본 헌법이 규정하는 작업 방식, 검증 절차, 로그 구조는 불변이다.

---

## Article II — Replaceable Shell Doctrine

외부 기술 변화는 Adapter 또는 MCP를 통해서만 흡수된다.  
직접 결합(hard-binding)은 금지된다.

---

## Article III — Operator Supremacy

AI는 제안·실행 주체가 될 수 있으나,  
최종 판단·책임·통제는 항상 사용자에게 귀속된다.

---

## Article IV — Evolution Shock Absorption

AI와 UI의 급격한 변화는  
사용자 작업 흐름에 직접적인 영향을 주어서는 안 된다.

---

## Article V — Immutable Core & Replaceable Shell

AI, UI, 도구는 Replaceable Shell이다.  
작업 규칙, 검증, 로그는 Immutable Core이다.

---

## Article VI — Execution Environment Stack

본 시스템은 다음 실행 환경을 병행 허용한다.

- Cursor + Claude (설계·탐색)
- Claude CLI + MCP (실행·검증)
- RALPH Research OS (통제·거버넌스)

---

## Article VII — Vibe Studio Separation

Vibe Studio는 RALPH 위에서 동작하는 작업장이다.  
RALPH 규칙을 우회하는 UI 설계는 실패로 간주한다.
