# Methods: RALPH Research OS Framework

## System Design
RALPH enforces research governance above model execution.

## Constitutional Control
All outputs are validated against immutable rules.

## Profile-Based Execution
Profiles define allowed operations and output contracts.

## Loop-Based Verification
- Iterative refinement
- Explicit verification
- No silent completion

## Reproducibility
Every state, decision, and verification is logged.

## Model Independence
Execution engines are replaceable without spec change.
